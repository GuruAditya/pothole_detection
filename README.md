Developed and trained an object detection model using YOLOv8 (a deep learning CNN) to 
accurately identify and locate potholes in road images with high accuracy. 
Engineered and deployed a user-friendly web application using Flask, Streamlit that allows users 
to upload images and receive real-time pothole annotations. 
Managed the full project lifecycle, including data preprocessing, model selection, training, 
validation, and final deployment on Heroku.
